\section{Research Gap \& Questions}
\label{sec:gap-and-questions}

Current approaches to multi-hazard susceptibility mapping are often limited in scope, focusing on single hazards or small geographic areas. \cite{Pourghasemi} While statistical methods and machine learning techniques have been applied in some contexts, their ability to model interactions between hazards remains underexplored in Europe. The unpublished study by Tiggeloven et al. demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning in integrating multiple hazards for Japan. However, the applicability of this framework to other regions, such as Europe, has not been validated \cite{SAKICTROGRLIC2024103774}.

\subsection{Research Question}
How can a deep learning framework be adapted to map multi-hazard susceptibility across Europe effectively?

\subsection{Sub-Questions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What are the most effective deep learning architectures (CNNs, Transformers) for multi-hazard susceptibility modeling?
	\item How can transfer learning from the Japan study improve model performance for data-scarce hazards in Europe?
	\item How do susceptibility patterns vary across Europe, and what are the implications for disaster preparedness?
\end{itemize}
