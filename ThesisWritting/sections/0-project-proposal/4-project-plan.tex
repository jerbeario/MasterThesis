\section{Project Plan}
\label{sec:project_plan}

This research is structured into five phases over 14 weeks. The first phase focuses on preparing pre-engineered features for modeling, followed by training CNNs and Transformers to predict individual hazard susceptibilities. In the next phase, transfer learning will be applied to enhance predictions for data-scarce hazards. In the third phase, individual hazard models will be integrated into a unified multi-hazard susceptibility map using ensemble methods. Validation against the MYRIAD dataset will ensure model reliability. The final phase involves analyzing susceptibility patterns and completing the thesis document, with a buffer period for revisions.
